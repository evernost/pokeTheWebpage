# pokeTheWebpage
Makes some ringy-ring if a change happened on a webpage that rarely does.


## Installation
- git clone the repository
- create a python environment: `> python -m venv venv`
- call the environment: `> ./venv/Scripts/activate`
- install the libs: `> pip install -r main/requirements.txt`
- call the script: `> python main/src/main.py`

Initialise the variable `URL` in `main.py` with your target webpage.

That's it! You'll be notified as soon as anything changes on the webpage.
